The "Campus Assessment: Doctor Listing Page" is a web-based project designed to present a clear and organized listing of doctors.  Here's a breakdown:

Purpose: The primary goal is to provide easy access to information about doctors, likely within a campus or healthcare setting. This could be for students, faculty, staff, or visitors needing to find medical professionals.

Content: The page displays a list of doctors.  The specific details shown for each doctor could include:

Name

Specialization (e.g., General Physician, Pediatrician, Dermatologist)

Contact information (e.g., phone number, email, office location)

Possibly other relevant details like office hours, qualifications, or a brief bio.

Target Audience: The intended users are individuals seeking medical care or information about doctors within a specific community, such as a university campus.

Technical Aspects:

The page is built using standard web technologies:

HTML for structuring the content.

CSS for styling the page's appearance.

JavaScript (if there's any interactivity, such as filtering the list or displaying more details).

The design emphasizes a user-friendly interface, making it easy to find the needed information quickly.  It should also be responsive, meaning it works well on different devices (desktops, tablets, and smartphones).
